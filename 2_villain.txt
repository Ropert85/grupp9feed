The Villain, aka Brandon, aka the evil mastermind, was once a student at Hackademin. He used to go to the same class as our hero and his sidekick. He hated kanelbullar. He was more of a kardemumma-guy. For 2 years he had to stand the smell of kanelbullar from our hero and his sidekick. But no more. It was time for the kardemumma to reign.
