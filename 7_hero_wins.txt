As Brandon laughs maniacally at the hero’s demise, and Joel is beating up the old lady, Gulfin realizes he has to do something. But how can he overcome this obstacle.. Then it hits him! Of course! He needs to eat a kanelbulle to get his powers back!

”Joel!” he shouts. ”Does the old lady you just beat up have a kanelbulle in her bag?” 

Joel stares at him. ”Why in the world would she have a…” He glances at her bag. Wow, she actually have one. He throws it to Gulfin. Gulfin munches it down and can move again. Gulfin beats Joel up for hitting the lady, and then beats up Brandon (although Brandon only lost because he didn’t have his gröt in the morning. He’s way stronger than Gulfin when he has his gröt).
