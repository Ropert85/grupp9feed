Gulfin is back in Hackademin once again, as he meets the woman from his first day at the academy. Their eyes meet, and she rushes up to him. ”Hey! You’re that guy who saved the old woman on the subway right? That was amazing!” 

Gulfin responds: ”I know right. Want to marry me?”
”Yes! Let’s go to Vegas and ditch school and live happily ever after!”
He carries her in his arm, as he throws her up on his horse Jonas and rides towards the sunset.
